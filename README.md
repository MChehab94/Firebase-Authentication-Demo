This is a simple demo that shows how to use Firebase authentication that allows users to:
* signin to your application
* signup to your application
* send verification email upon signup
* reset password
There are two modules:
* javafirebaseeauthentication: This module contains the Java implementation.  
* app: This module contains the Kotlin implementation.

# Important Note
**The project DOES NOT contain the google-services.json file, you must create your own Firebase project and use your own google-services.json file in order to be able to use this project. 
You can check this post [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/01/14/android-how-to-set-up-firebase-in-your-project/) where I thoroughly 
cover how you can integrate Firebase in your project, or feel free to check the official documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).**
